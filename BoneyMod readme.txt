Hi folks, Boney M here. I've surrendered to my ego and called this mod BoneyMod.

This mod is based on the 1.01 version of Defiler Wings from Old Huntsman, and incorporates a few changes from a mod posted by an Anonymous /d/eviant back in December. All changes listed below were done by me except where otherwise noted. To install, just copy over the 'game' folder to the folder that Defiler Wings is installed to and allow it to overwrite the duplicate files.

Blanket permission given for anyone to use this as a basis for further modifications, just give me credit somewhere in the readme.


0.3

Gameplay:
- Made it so that eating geese in the sky reduces hunger.
- Let the player visit the Smugglers Isle when out of energy, just like they can visit the Gremlin Village.
- Added an option for moderately intimidating dragons to extort the travelling noblewoman on the roads for her handmaiden, a merchant's daughter.
- Slightly increased the payment for extorting a medium-sized merchant caravan so it's more rewarding than extorting the small one.
- Buffed blue heads by adding a moderately powerful poison attack bonus - seemed appropriate, as sea snakes have powerful venom.

Bugs fixed:
- One of the options in the girls picking berries encounter was not always displaying properly.
- Conjuring poisonous vapours to kill everyone in the inn wasn't taking energy.

Clarity and spelling:
- When flying into the marketplace, it used the same dialogue for sneaking in with a magical disguise. Made it more ambiguous to cover both possibilities.
- Changed dialogue of encounters with sharks and griffins to make it clear that eating them grants a point of magical power to the dragon.
- Changed dialogue of fourth task, which suggested hired servants may steal from you, to instead specify they require payment.
- Changed dialogue from girls escaping from the lair or starving to death to indicate what would prevent that to help new players.
- Changed the tavern's description to make it clear it's destruction would increase poverty (which it always has).
- Removed a confusing reference to a 'nice ring' in the treasures gained from looting the outpost in the roads - there's no rings in the loot, might have been a mistranslation.
- Various typos and missing punctuation.


0.2

Gameplay:
- Tweaked thief AI so that they're more likely to push their luck, especially if they're facing traps or poisonous guards. Before, low-skill thieves were essentially save scumming the dragon's lair by continually trying to get past the traps and poisonous guards and falling back without risk if they couldn't get further.
- Changed the encounter with slavers in the mountains so you can fight them for a merchant's daughter even if the dragon is out of lust.

Bugs fixed:
- Thieves being killed by the dragon's defences wasn't counting for the mission to defend your lair against a thief or knight.
- Eating horses in the haycart encounter on the roads wasn't reducing hunger.
- Going through the Dwarvern backdoor wasn't reducing energy.
- Attacking the outpost on the trade routes was taking a second point of energy if the dragon won the fight.
- It was possible to conjure poisonous fog to kill the people barricaded in the tavern even if you were out of mana.
- It was possible to encounter training militia when flying around the sky even if mobilisation was at 0.

Clarity and spelling:
- Changed the ogre den location names to match the format of the rest of them.
- Changed all references to 'the' dwarvern kingdom to 'a' dwarvern kingdom instead, since it's possibly to attack and claim the dwarvern kingdom over and over again.
- Night vs knight, drgagon vs dragon, misplaced fullstops, extra spaces and capitalisations scattered about the place.


0.1

Gameplay:
- Changed silver head from +1 magic and lightning immune to lightning breath and lightning immune to match the description.
- Changed the griffin bonus from attack bonus to magic bonus, since in the code the magic bonus is 'griffin_meat' - this also adds a new way to get extra magic to non-blue dragons with wings, since currently the only animal that gives magic boost is sharks. Got the idea from Anonymous /d/eviant's mod, but his implementation broke the witch's ability to give magical power.
- Wrote non-generic combat text for the treant fight in the Enchanted Wood.
- Imprisoned girls are retained when switching lairs - from the Anonymous /d/eviant's mod.
- Changed the Venopus and Sea Bastard spawns (from impregnating mermaids) so that the more difficult to create Sea Bastards are the more powerful of the two - from the Anonymous /d/eviant's mod.

Bugfix:
- Fixed an infuriating bug that was causing thieves, when unable to reach the dragon's lair, to immediately teleport to it.
- Fixed a bug that would cause attacking the carriage carrying a noblewoman to not take an action.
- Fixed bug that made the 'Absolute Predator' achievement impossible - from the Anonymous /d/eviant's mod.

Clarity:
- Changed 'sabotage thief' to 'assassinate thief', since it essentially kills the thief instead of just misleading them for a time as the current text would suggest.
- Renamed some of the spells so all of the Breath spells were listed together, because it's in alphabetical order because otherwise it's in a random order. I don't know why.
- Made it so the girls have different dialogue that tells you whether she's a virgin, pregnant, or neither.
- Made it so the 'Back Door' location on the Places menu changes to 'Sealed Back Door' if it's sealed.
- Changed the picture when visiting a looted enchanted wood from the generic ruins to the normal enchanted wood picture.

Translation and spelling:
- Changed 'monasty' to 'monastery'.
- Corrected the 'saber claws' trait, which is more accurately translated as 'sabertooth' and was making me wonder why and how a dragon with no legs had saber claws, and how a dragon could have razor sharp claws and saber claws at the same time.
- Corrected the names of the Jormungandr and Lernaean Hydra achievements.
- A number of very minor spelling and grammar corrections.
